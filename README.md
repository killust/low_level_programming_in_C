# MPI (Message Passing Interface) 
MPI is a standard used for parallel programming on distributed memory systems, such as clusters and supercomputers. It allows multiple processes, often running on different physical machines, to communicate by passing messages. MPI is widely used in high-performance computing (HPC) for tasks like simulations and large-scale data processing. Programs using MPI are typically written in C, C++, or Fortran and use libraries like OpenMPI or MPICH.

# OpenCL (Open Computing Language) 
OpenCL is a framework for parallel programming across heterogeneous systems that may include CPUs, GPUs, and other processors. It enables developers to write code that runs efficiently on a wide range of hardware by dividing tasks into kernels that can execute in parallel. OpenCL is especially useful for accelerating tasks like graphics, machine learning, and scientific computing on GPUs, while still being portable across different vendors and platforms.
